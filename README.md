Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  it is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems, and,  
  it involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
  software engineering enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication,         commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  The tree milestones are,1. Development of programming languages e.g., Fortran, C,2. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s,3.   Advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  1. Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
  2. Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  3. Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  4. Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  5. Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
  6. Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  Waterfall: Sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g., requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall, while,
  Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change. Notable companies like Facebook, Google, and     Amazon use Agile due to its adaptability and customer-focused approach. Projects involving new product development or 	process improvement use the         Waterfall model, e.g., Toyota employs the Waterfall method for software development.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
	Software Developer is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions. 
	Quality Assurance Engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
	Project Manager oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
	IDEs are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, 	IntelliJ IDEA).
	VCS are Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
	Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
	Tight Deadlines brings Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
	Technical Debt are accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase 	maintenance costs.
	Strategies for overcoming these challenges include, effective communication, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and, regular 	reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
	Unit Testing is the testing of individual components or modules of software.
	Integration Testing it`s the testing of interactions between different components or subsystems.
	System Testing it`s the testing of the entire software system as a whole.
	Acceptance Testing it`s Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.
	Testing helps identify and fix defects early in the development process, leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
	Prompt engineering it`s all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
	Prompt engineering helps by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
	'Tell me about chilidogs' is a vague prompt, 'Give me a step-by-step recipe for making a cheese chilidog' is a well-engineered prompt because itâ€™s clear,   concise, and specific, keywords that guide the AI towards the kind of response you want.
